# Coagulate SL Services

This package is the co-ordinator, the "kernel" of this system, that then loads various detected modules to provide applications.

You probably don't care much about this package directly, other than it contains an SQL schema which is necessary, and a template properties file.

If you're here for GPHUD, see that repo instead
